## About

This repository contains examples of ColdFusion code in both `.cfm` and `.cfc` files.

## What is ColdFusion?

ColdFusion is a rapid web application development platform that allows developers to easily create dynamic websites and web applications. It is a powerful and flexible language that runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

## Installation

- First install coldfusion from the [Adobe website](https://www.adobe.com/products/coldfusion/download-trial/try.html). 
- Double-click the installer to start the installation process. 
- Follow the prompts in the installer to complete the installation. 
- You will need to accept the license agreement and choose the installation directory. When prompted, choose a web server to configure ColdFusion with. 
- The installer can configure Apache, IIS, or a built-in web server. 
- If you are using a database with ColdFusion, you will need to configure the database connection during the installation process. 
- You can also configure this later using the ColdFusion Administrator.
- Once the installation is complete, you can access the ColdFusion Administrator by navigating to http://localhost:8500/CFIDE/administrator/index.cfm in your web browser. From here, you can configure various settings, including data sources, mail servers, and debugging options.

Then you can download individual files from this repository, copy and paste code, or clone the repository with
